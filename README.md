# Coding-Interviews
In this repository, there are different resources to prepare for coding interviews and behavioural interviews. Those interviews are considered the most challenging phase of the tech job recruitment process.

## Who am I?

My name is Itamar Rocha Filho; I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at Google, and I've also received some offers from different companies. :D

## Resources
In this section, there are many resources, divided on:

* Books
* Courses
* Websites
* Youtube Channels
* Other Resources
* My roadmap

### Books

The best book to prepare for coding interviews is cracking the coding interview. The book can be accessed on this [link](https://cin.ufpe.br/~fbma/Crack/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf).

A more in-depth overview of the different algorithms and data structures is [Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844).

If you want to dive even deeper, you can also study competitive programming with [the Competitive Programming Book](https://cpbook.net/)

In my opinion, the craking the coding interview is the best book to study, because it has a focus on interviews. Just be sure to use it along with one of the websites to practice the coding questions. Practice is the key.

### Courses

* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0)
* Crash Course on Algoexpert

### Websites

* [Algoexpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/) (Beginner friendly)
  Platform with crash courses on data structures and algorithms, extra material on behavioural interviews and many different problems. 49$ yearly subscription, with 5$ discount using clem as promo code.

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (Not beginner friendly)
  The most famous platform contains more than 1600 exercises and a strong community.

* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/)
  Excellent platform to train for actual coding interviews. You pair up with another person studying for coding interviews, and you interview each other.
  
* [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
  Many exercises and different crash courses on programming languages too. It also has roadmaps to help you prepare better.
 
### Youtube Channels

* [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g)

### Other Resources

I'm currently subscribed to the [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/), and I have been trying to keep up with it for the last few months. It is an excellent resource for practising for the interviews. You receive a different exercise every day about a subject (which changes every week). On leetcode, you can find almost all the exercises. I have a repository where I store my code there, and you can check it on this [link](https://github.com/ItamarRocha/DailyByte).

### Roadmap

To prepare for my interviews, I read cracking the coding interview as an introduction to the topic. Then, I used algoexpert, where I did the crash courses and some of the available exercises. After training, I started using pramp (where I did approximately 30 interviews) and leetcode. Nowadays, I'm not studying as much as before, so I try to keep up with the Daily Byte and eventually do some exercises on leetcode.
