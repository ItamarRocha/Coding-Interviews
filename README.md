## Resources
In this section there are many resources, divided on:

* Books
* Courses
* Websites
* Youtube Channels
* My roadmap

### Books

The best book to prepare for coding interviews is cracking the coding interview. The book can be acessed on this [link](https://cin.ufpe.br/~fbma/Crack/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf).

A book with a more in depth overview of the different algorithms and data structures is [Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844).

If you want to dive even deeper you can also study competitive programming with [the Competitive Programming Book](https://cpbook.net/)

### Courses

* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0)
* Crash Course on Algoexpert

### Websites

* [Algoexpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/) (Beginner friendly)
  Platform with crash courses on data structures and algorithms, along with extra material on behavioral interviews and many different problems. 49$ yearly subscription, with 5$ discount using clem as promo code.

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (Not beginner friendly)
  Most famous platform, contains more than 1600 exercises and a strong community.

* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/)
  Very good platform to train for real coding interviews. You basically pair up with another person that is also studying for coding interviews and you interview each other.
  
* [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
  Many exercises and different crash courses on programming languages too. It also has roadmaps to help you prepare better.

### Other Resources

I'm currently subscribed to the [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/) and I have been trying to keep up with it on the last few months. It is an excellent resource for practicing for the interviews because you receive a different exercise everyday about a subject (which changes every week) and almost all exercises can be found on leetcode. I have a repository where I store my code there, you can check it on this [link](https://github.com/ItamarRocha/DailyByte).
